# Breast_Cancer_Classification

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women, affecting about 10% of all women at some stages of their life.

In recent years, the incidence rate keeps increasing and data show that the survival rate
is 88% after five years from diagnosis and 80% after 10 years from diagnosis.

Early prediction of breast cancer is one of the most crucial works in the follow-up process.

Data mining methods can help to reduce the number of false positive and false negative decisions.

Consequently, new methods such as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) has become a popular research tool
for medical researchers who try to identify and exploit patterns and relationships among large number of variables, 
and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets.
